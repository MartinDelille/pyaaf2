pyaaf2
======

Work in progress, a rewrite of [pyaaf](https://github.com/markreidvfx/pyaaf) in pure python.
Its still really rough, if you need to read and write aaf files use pyaaf.

What works
----------

- low level reading and writing Compound File Binary files
- basic reading aaf objects and properties
